**Provide the python file with any Category page from Wikipedia (The starting part of the URL is: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:<category name>" e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Physics) and the file will provide you with the complete list of pages of the category as well as as all subcategories under the category provided** 

My previous repositories were split into two different objectives:
1. [Repo 1](https://github.com/SwamiKannan/Scraping-the-Wikipedia-Category-Hierarchy) - Crawl the category page and download the list of subcategories of each page - basically, map the hierarchy from the parent category
2. [Repo 2](https://github.com/SwamiKannan/Extracting-content-from-Wikidumps-XML-files)- Extract the XML file from Wiki:Export and convert it to a JSON file
